# python-blackjack
This program is a simple command line blackjack simulator. The game will first ask how many chips the user would like to start with. Each round begins with the game asking how many chips you would like to bet. It will then cycle through a hand of blackjack and if you have chips remaining it will ask the user if they'd like to play another round. If the user runs out of chips they can choose to restart with a new number of chips.

### Assumptions:
- The player knows the rules to standard blackjack
